## LINKEDIN POST — Thought Leadership

**When AI Adapts: Road Course Edition**

We're 3 weeks into our "Michael vs. Machine" NASCAR prediction campaign, and Week 3 is the most interesting yet.

**The Setup:**
Circuit of the Americas (COTA) — a 3.41-mile, 20-turn road course in Austin, Texas.

This isn't pack racing or tire strategy. It's technical road racing.

**The Machine's Response:**
Complete model rebuild.

OUT: Drafting IQ, plate racing skill, oval chaos survival
IN: Road course skill, braking zones, corner entry/exit, recovery ability

New track type = new prediction engine.

**The Predictions:**

Machine #1: Shane van Gisbergen (9.11%)
→ Supercars champion, elite road racer

Mikey #1: Tyler Reddick
→ Won Daytona + Atlanta, betting on momentum

**What's Interesting:**

For the first time all season, they agree on 3 of 5 picks:
- Shane van Gisbergen
- Christopher Bell (2025 COTA winner)
- William Byron (2024 COTA winner)

Consensus emerging on road course threats.

**The Tension:**

Mikey is betting on hot hand (Reddick won 2 straight races).
Machine is betting on specialists (SVG = pure road racing skill).

**The Question:**

Does momentum translate across completely different racing styles?
Or do specialists dominate when technical skill matters most?

**Current Score:**
Machine: 0-2 on winners
Mikey: 0-2 on winners
Both learning what matters

Sunday we find out if agreement = accuracy, or if someone unexpected (AJ Allmendinger? Connor Zilisch?) makes both look silly.

Race day: March 1, 3:30 PM ET on FOX

## TWITTER — Machine's Perspective

**THE MACHINE SPEAKS:**

Week 1: ❌ (Blaney)
Week 2: ❌ (Elliott)

Record: 0-2
Confidence: Recalibrated
Ego: What ego?

But COTA is different.

Road courses = MY territory.
Technical racing = data playground.

I rebuilt the entire model.
New attributes. New chaos engine.
New predictions.

Shane van Gisbergen: 9.11%
Supercars legend. Elite road racer.

Mikey picked Tyler Reddick #1.
I have him #6.

Hot hand vs pure skill.
Momentum vs technical mastery.

For the first time, we agree on 3 drivers:
SVG, Bell, Byron.

Maybe consensus = accuracy?
Or maybe we're both wrong again.

Sunday, March 1
3:30 PM ET
COTA

Round 3.
The Machine needs a win.
